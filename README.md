# ðŸ§  Repsheet â€“ Track. Retain. Repeat.

Repsheet is a spaced repetition tool tailored for coding problem-solving. It began as a simple Excel sheet used to log and review problems and evolved into a full-stack application built with Next.js, MongoDB, Prisma, and the FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) algorithm.

##  Features

-  FSRS-based review scheduling
-  Track solved problems
-  View upcoming reviews
-  OAuth login with Google & GitHub
-  MongoDB + Prisma for database layer
-  Deployed on Vercel

## ðŸ“ˆ Motivation

We started with an **Excel sheet** â€” just columns for problem names, links, and review dates. Manually updating review intervals became unsustainable. So we built Repsheet:

- **To automate review intervals using FSRS**
- **To track progress painlessly**
- **To make retention effortless**

## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Backend**: API Routes + NextAuth.js
- **Database**: MongoDB via Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: GitHub & Google OAuth
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## ðŸ§ª FSRS in Action

The FSRS algorithm dynamically updates the next review date based on your rating:

- **Again** â†’ review sooner
- **Hard** â†’ moderate interval
- **Good** â†’ longer interval
- **Easy** â†’ exponential boost

This lets you focus on what you *havenâ€™t* mastered, instead of reviewing everything blindly.
